I have been passionate about technology since I was very young! I like challenges, books, developing new technologies using logic and analytical thinking.

I have knowledge in: Python, Pandas, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, Servers, Networks, HTML, CSS, Git, Windows and SCRUM.

At the moment I'm programming in Python, which has become my favorite language and I'm studying SQL, these two languages â€‹â€‹are the ones I'm focusing on at the moment. My passion besides programming is playing the guitar, keyboard and drums, and I also like watching anime and reading books every day.
